### Product inspiration, gaps in competitors
* yelp : (pros: local services, search results) (cons: 5-star rating system doesnt differentiate quality of customer service, price per value, reviews are either testimonials, complaints) (gap: quantifiable review system with ad-hoc criteria/category similar to hashtags)
* google maps : (pros: comprehensive place search used as basis for local discovery mechanism, placeid) (con: not practical for focused deep use cases) (gap: retail owners use it for marketing purposes, similar to yelp; placeid are too tightly coupled on property addresses, when properties contain multiple businesses//placeids this system is not practical)
* tripadvisor : (pros: ad-hoc discussion forum) (cons: infinite sub-thread pyramids) (gap: post engagement, upvote/downvote comments/replies encourages social agreement to discussion points)
* coolcousin : (pros:)
* craigslist : (pros: )
* airbnb : (pros: )
